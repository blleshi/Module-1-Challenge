# FinTech Case Study: RobinHood

## Overview and Origin
This case study will discuss the overview and origin of the somewhat controversial FinTech brokerage platform, RobinHood Markets. Founded in Menlo Park, California, U.S.A., in 2013, by two New York City high-frequency trading developers, Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, the RobinHood most millenials and younger know plays on the medieval story of the legendary Robinhood, the outlaw who would take from the rich and give to the poor. Today's version of RobinHood has a similar mission-- RobinHood claims to provide a platform in financial markets for everyone, not just the wealthy. 

## Business Activities
The only requirements to trade on RobinHood Markets are to be a U.S. citizen who is over the age of 18 years. Unlike other financial institutions, like Vanguard, for example, that have certain barriers to market entry for more "volatile" stocks and currencies, like cryptocurreny, by having options commissions, fractional investing share for ETFs, and other limitations. RobinHood has no such restrictions, which is how it lives up to its claims of being a platform for all traders, regardless of financial market literacy. WIth its clear attempt to market trading to younger generations, RobinHood facilitates hassle-free investment options for budding traders.
